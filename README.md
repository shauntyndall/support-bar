Support Bar
===========

Support Bar is a module for Drupal that adds a toolbar for privileged users along the bottom of the screen, that allows them to contact the site administrator contact at any time from any page in the website.

You can customize it by adding your company logo, phone number, and email address. When a user (usually the client) needs assistance, they can email/contact you directly from that page for better support.
